# Cryptogram

Cryptogram is a simple encryption project that allows you to encrypt a string using different encryption algorithms.

## Files

- `cryptogram_Encryption.py`: This file is the main script for encryption.
- `cryptogram_Functions.py`: Contains all the necessary functions required for the `cryptogram_Encryption.py` file.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to use the Cryptogram project:

### Step 1: Save Files

Save both files (`cryptogram_Encryption.py` and `cryptogram_Functions.py`) in a single directory.

### Step 2: Run the Encryption Script

Execute `cryptogram_Encryption.py` to start the encryption process.

### Step 3: Enter String and Choose Algorithm

Enter the string you want to encrypt when prompted. Then, choose the encryption algorithm according to your preference.

That's it! The encrypted result will be displayed.

## Encryption Algorithms

The project supports multiple encryption algorithms. Make sure to choose the one that suits your requirements.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different strings and encryption options!
