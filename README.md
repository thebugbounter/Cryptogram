# Cryptogram
Cryptogram is a Python-based project that provides a simple yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt messages using the hashlib package. This project is designed to enhance the security of your sensitive information through the implementation of popular hashing algorithms.

## Files

- `cryptogram_Encryption.py`: This file is the main script for encryption.
- `cryptogram_Functions.py`: Contains all the necessary functions required for the `cryptogram_Encryption.py` file.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to use the Cryptogram project:

### Step 1: Save Files

Save both files (`cryptogram_Encryption.py` and `cryptogram_Functions.py`) in a single directory.

### Step 2: Run the Encryption Script

Execute `cryptogram_Encryption.py` to start the encryption process.

### Step 3: Enter String and Choose Algorithm

Enter the string you want to encrypt when prompted. Then, choose the encryption algorithm according to your preference.

That's it! The encrypted result will be displayed.

## Encryption Algorithms

The project supports multiple encryption algorithms. Make sure to choose the one that suits your requirements.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different strings and encryption options!
